Implementing regularized linear regression
\textbf{Solutions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Get more training example - fixes high variance
\item Trying a smaller set of features - fixes high variance
\item Trying to get additional features - usually fixes high variance
\item Trying out polynomial features - often fixes high bias
\item Try decreasing lambda - fixes high bias
\item Try increasing lambda - fixes high variance
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Neural Networks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Small computationally cheap, but prone to underfitting.
\item Large computationally complex, but prone to overfitting.
\end{itemize}
