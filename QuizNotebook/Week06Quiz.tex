\section{Week 6: Advice for Applying Machine Learning}

\subsection*{Question 1. }
You train a learning algorithm, and find that it has unacceptably high error on the test set. You plot the learning curve, and obtain the figure below. Is the algorithm suffering from high bias, high variance, or neither?



Neither

High variance

High bias
%-----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 2. }
Suppose you have implemented regularized logistic regression  to classify what object is in an image (i.e., to do object recognition). However, when you test your hypothesis on a new set of images, you find that it makes unacceptably large 
errors with its predictions on the new images. However, your

hypothesis performs well (has low error) on the

training set. Which of the following are promising steps to

take? Check all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Try increasing the regularization parameter $\lambda$.
\item 
Try evaluating the hypothesis on a cross validation set rather than the test set.
\item 
Try using a smaller set of features.
\item 
Try decreasing the regularization parameter $\lambda$.
\end{itemize}
%-----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 3. }
Suppose you have implemented regularized logistic regression

to predict what items customers will purchase on a web shopping site. However, when you test your hypothesis on a new

set of customers, you find that it makes unacceptably large errors in its predictions. Furthermore, the hypothesis

performs poorly on the training set. Which of the following might be promising steps to take? Check all that

apply.

\begin{itemize}
\item Try decreasing the regularization parameter $\lambda$.

\item Use fewer training examples.

\item Try evaluating the hypothesis on a cross validation set rather than the test set.

\item Try adding polynomial features.
\end{itemize}
%-----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 4. }
Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.

Suppose you are training a regularized linear regression model. The recommended way to choose what value of regularization parameter $\lambda$ to use is to choose the value of $\lambda$ which gives the lowest test set error.

Suppose you are training a regularized linear regression model. The recommended way to choose what value of regularization parameter $\lambda$ to use is to choose the value of $\lambda$ which gives the lowest cross validation error.

The performance of a learning algorithm on the training set will typically be better than its performance on the test set.

Suppose you are training a regularized linear regression model.The recommended way to choose what value of regularization parameter $\lambda$ to use is to choose the value of $\lambda$ which gives the lowest training set error.

%-----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 5. }
Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.

A model with more parameters is more prone to overfitting and typically has higher variance. SELECTED

If the training and test errors are about the same, adding more features will not help improve the results. SELECTED

If a learning algorithm is suffering from high variance, adding more training examples is likely to improve the test error.

If a learning algorithm is suffering from high bias, only adding more training examples may not improve the test error significantly.

\section*{Week 6: Machine Learning System Design}

\subsection*{Question 1} 
You are working on a spam classification system using regularized logistic regression. "Spam" is a positive class (y = 1) and "not spam" is the negative class (y = 0). You have trained your classifier and there are m = 1000 examples in the cross-validation set. The chart of predicted class vs. actual class is:


\begin{tabular}{ccc}
& Actual Class: 1	& Actual Class: 0 \\
Predicted Class: 1 &	85&	890 \\ 
Predicted Class: 0 &	15&	10\\
\end{tabular} 

\begin{framed}
For reference:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Accuracy = (true positives + true negatives) / (total examples)
	\item Precision = (true positives) / (true positives + false positives)
	\item Recall = (true positives) / (true positives + false negatives)
	\item F1 score = (2 $\times$ precision $\times$ recall) / (precision + recall)
\end{itemize}

\end{framed}
What is the classifier's precision (as a value from 0 to 1)?

Enter your answer in the box below. If necessary, provide at least two values after the decimal point.

0.09
%----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Question 1} 
CORRECT
Suppose a massive dataset is available for training a learning algorithm. Training on a lot of data is likely to give good performance when two of the following conditions hold true.

Which are the two?


When we are willing to include high

order polynomial features of x (such as x21, x22,

x1x2, etc.).

SELECTED The features x contain sufficient

information to predict y accurately. (For example, one

way to verify this is if a human expert on the domain

can confidently predict y when given only x).


SELECTED  We train a learning algorithm with a

large number of parameters (that is able to

learn/represent fairly complex functions).



We train a learning algorithm with a

small number of parameters (that is thus unlikely to

overfit).

%----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Question 3.}


Suppose you have trained a logistic regression classifier which is outputing $h\theta(x)$.


Currently, you predict 1 if $h\theta(x) \geq $threshold, and predict 
0 if $h\theta(x)$ < threshold, where currently the threshold is set to 0.5.

Suppose you decrease the threshold to 0.1. Which of the following are true? Check all that apply.

The classifier is likely to have unchanged precision and recall, but

lower accuracy.

The classifier is likely to now have higher precision.

SELECTED The classifier is likely to now have higher recall.

The classifier is likely to have unchanged precision and recall, but

higher accuracy.

%----------------------%

The classifier is likely to have unchanged precision and recall, and

thus the same F1 score.

The classifier is likely to have unchanged precision and recall, but

higher accuracy.


SELECTED The classifier is likely to now have lower precision.

The classifier is likely to now have lower recall.

%----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 4.} WRONG
Suppose you are working on a spam classifier, where spam

emails are positive examples (y=1) and non-spam emails are

negative examples (y=0). You have a training set of emails

in which 99% of the emails are non-spam and the other 1% is

spam. Which of the following statements are true? Check all

that apply.


WRONG If you always predict spam (output y=1),

your classifier will have a recall of 0% and precision

of 99%.


WRONG If you always predict non-spam (output

y=0), your classifier will have a recall of

0%.


CORRECT If you always predict spam (output y=1),

your classifier will have a recall of 100% and precision

of 1%.



CORRECT If you always predict non-spam (output

y=0), your classifier will have an accuracy of

99%.

%----------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection*{Question 5.}

Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
\item CORRECT Using a very large training set
	
	makes it unlikely for model to overfit the training
	
	data.
	
	
\item 	WRONG If your model is underfitting the
	
	training set, then obtaining more data is likely to
	
	help.
	
\item 	CORRECT The "error analysis" process of manually
	
	examining the examples which your algorithm got wrong
	
	can help suggest what are good steps to take (e.g.,
	
	developing new features) to improve your algorithm's
	
	performance.
	
	
	
\item	WRONG It is a good idea to spend a lot of time
	
	collecting a large amount of data before building
	
	your first version of a learning algorithm.
	
	
	
\item WRONG After training a logistic regression
	
	classifier, you must use 0.5 as your threshold
	
	for predicting whether an example is positive or
	
	negative.
