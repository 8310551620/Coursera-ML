You'd like to use polynomial regression to predict a student's ჌▘nal exam score
from their midterm exam score. Concretely, suppose you want to ჌▘t a model
of the form , where is the midterm score and
is (midterm score) . Further, you plan to use both feature scaling (dividing
by the "max-min", or range, of a feature) and mean normalization.
What is the normalized feature ? (Hint: midterm = 72, fial = 74 is training
example 2.) 


Please round your answer to two decimal places and enter in
the text box below.

%----------------------------------------%

Suppose you have training examples with features (excluding
the additional all-ones feature for the intercept term, which you should add).
The normal equation is . For the given values of and
, what are the dimensions of , , and in this equation?

%---------------------------------------%
\subsection{Question 4}
Suppose you have a dataset with m = 1000000 examples and n=200000
features for each example. You want to use multivariate linear regression to
fit the parameters $\theta$ to our data. Should you prefer gradient descent or the
normal equation?

\subsection*{Overfitting and Regularization}

\begin{itemize}
\item If one neural network overfits the training set, one reasonable step is to
increase the regularization parameter $\lambda$.
\item For computational efficiency, after we performed gradient checking to verify that our back-propagation 
code is correct, we usually disable gradient checkking before using back-propagation to train
the network
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Exercise}
Let $ J(\theta) = 3\theta^2 + 2$

Let $\theta = 1$ and $\epsilon = 0.01$

Use the formula to numerically compute an approximation to the derivative of $\theta$
at $theta = 1$

\[
\frac{J(\theta + \epsilon) - J(\theta + \epsilon)}{2\epsilon} 
= \frac{(3(1.01)^2 + 2$)-(3(0.99)^2 + 2$)}{0.002} 
= 9.003

\subsection*{Question 1. }
For which of the following tasks might K-means clustering be a suitable algorithm? Select all that apply.


%=================================================================%
\subsection*{Question 2.} 
Suppose we have three cluster centroids $\mu_1$=$[1 2]^T$, $\mu_2$=$[−3 0]^T$ and $\mu_3$=$[4 2]^T$. 
Furthermore, we have a training example x(i)=$[3 1]^T$. After a cluster assignment step, what will $c^{(i)}$ be?

initializations, and obtain 50 different clusterings of the data.

\section{ML Week 8 : Machine Learning Clustering}

Suppose you have an unlabelled set of observations$\{ x^{(1)},x^{(2)},x^{(3)},x^{(4)}, \ldots ,x^{(n)}\}$.
You run $k-$means with 50 random initializations and obtain 50 different clusterings solution of the data.
What is the recommended way of choosing which solution to use.

\subsection{The Distortion Function}
For each of the clustering solutions, the distortion function is computed as 
\[ \frac{1}{m} \sum^{m}_{i=1} \parallel x^{(i)} - \mu_c^{(i)}\parallel ^2 \]
The optimal clustering solution is the solution that minizes the distortion function.
Since a lower value for a distortion function, implies a better clustering, you should choose the clustering with 
smallest value of the distortion function.




\subsection*{Finding Closest Centroids}

In the cluste assignment phase of the algorithm, the algorithm assigns every training example $x^{(n)}$ to the closest 
centroid, given the current position of the centroids.

\[ C^{(i)} := J \mbox{ that minimizes } \| x^{} - \mu_j \| ^2 \]

\begin{itemize}
\item $C^{(i)}$ index of the centroid clostest to $x^{(i)}$
\item $\mu_j$ is the position of the $j-$th centroid.
\end{itemize}

%---------------%
\subsection{Computing Centroid Means}

\[ 
\mu_k := \frac{1}{abs(C_k)} \sum_{i \in C_k} x^{(i)}
\]
%---------------%

A good way to initialize k-mean is to select $k$ distinct examples from the training set and set the cluster centroids equal to these selected examples.

On every iteration of $k-$means, the cost function $J(C^{(1)},C^{(2)},\ldots, C^{(n)},
\mu_1,\ldots \mu_k)$

The distortion function should either stay the same or decrease, in particular it should not increase.

%---------------%
\subsection{Recommended Applications of PCA}

\begin{itemize}
\item Data Compression: reducing the dimensionof input data $x^{(i)}$, which will be used in a supervised learning algorithm
(i.e. use PCA data so that your supervised learning algorithm runs faster.

\item Data Visualization: Reduce data to 2D ( or 3D) so that it can be plotted.
\end{itemize}

\section{Principal Component Analysis}


\subsection{ Question 1. }

Consider the following 2D dataset:


Which of the following figures correspond to possible values that PCA may return for u(1) (the first eigenvector / first principal component)? 
Check all that apply (you may have to check more than one figure).

(Select both parallel vectors - Wrong)







%====================================================================%

\subsection{ Question 2. }
Which of the following is a reasonable way to select the number of principal components k?

(Recall that n is the dimensionality of the input data and m is the number of input examples.)

\begin{itemize}
\item Choose the value of k that minimizes the approximation error 1m∑mi=1||x(i)−x(i)approx||2.

\item Choose k to be the smallest value so that at least 1% of the variance is retained.

\item Choose k to be 99% of n (i.e., k=0.99∗n, rounded to the nearest integer).

\item Choose k to be the smallest value so that at least 99% of the variance is retained. [CORRECT - Selected]

\end{itemize}
%====================================================================%
\subsection{ Question 3. }
Suppose someone tells you that they ran PCA in such a way that "95% of the variance was retained." What is an equivalent statement to this?

1m∑mi=1||x(i)−x(i)approx||21m∑mi=1||x(i)||2≥0.95 [INCORRECT Selected]

1m∑mi=1||x(i)−x(i)approx||21m∑mi=1||x(i)||2≤0.05

1m∑mi=1||x(i)||21m∑mi=1||x(i)−x(i)approx||2≥0.95

1m∑mi=1||x(i)−x(i)approx||21m∑mi=1||x(i)||2≥0.05

%====================================================================%
\subsection{ Question 4. }
Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
\item Given an input x∈Rn, PCA compresses it to a lower-dimensional vector z∈Rk.

\item PCA can be used only to reduce the dimensionality of data by 1 (such as 3D to 2D, or 2D to 1D).

\item If the input features are on very different scales, it is a good idea to perform feature scaling before applying PCA.

\item Feature scaling is not useful for PCA, since the eigenvector calculation (such as using Octave's svd(Sigma) routine) takes care of this automatically.
\end{itemize}
%====================================================================%
\subsection{ Question 5. }
Which of the following are recommended applications of PCA? Select all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
\item [CORRECT] Data compression: Reduce the dimension of your data, so that it takes up less memory / disk space.

\item [CORRECT] Data compression: Reduce the dimension of your input data x(i), which will be used in a supervised learning algorithm (i.e., use PCA so that your supervised learning algorithm runs faster).

\item As a replacement for (or alternative to) linear regression: For most learning applications, PCA and linear regression give substantially similar results.

\item Data visualization: To take 2D data, and find a different way of plotting it in 2D (using k=2).

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Stochastic Gradient Checking}

\begin{itemize}
\item In each iteration of the stochastic gradient, the algorithm needs to examine/use only one training example.
\item Each iteration updates the parameters based on the cost of only one example $ Cost (\theta,(x^{(i)},y^{(i)}))$.
\item You can use numerical gradient checking to verify if your stochastic gradient descent implementation is bug-free.
\end{itemize}
