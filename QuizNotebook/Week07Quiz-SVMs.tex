\section{Week 7 Support Vector Machines}


%===================================================================%
\subsection*{Question 1}
Suppose you have trained an SVM classifier with a Gaussian kernel, and it learned the following decision boundary on the training set:
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/SVM1}
\caption{}
\label{fig:SVM1}
\end{figure}


You suspect that the SVM is underfitting your dataset. Should you try increasing or decreasing C? Increasing or decreasing $\sigma^2$?

\begin{itemize}
	\item It would be reasonable to try decreasing C. It would also be reasonable to try decreasing $\sigma^2$.
	
	\item It would be reasonable to try increasing C. It would also be reasonable to try decreasing $\sigma^2$.
	
	\item It would be reasonable to try increasing C. It would also be reasonable to try increasing $\sigma^2$.
	
	\item It would be reasonable to try decreasing C. It would also be reasonable to try increasing $\sigma^2$.
\end{itemize}


%===================================================================%
\subsection*{Question 2}
The formula for the Gaussian kernel is given by % similarity(x,l(1))=exp(−||x−l(1)||22σ2) .

The figure below shows a plot of f1=similarity(x,l(1)) when $\sigma^2 = 1$.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/SVM2}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Options}
Which of the following is a plot of f1 when $\sigma^2 = 0.25$?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Option 1\begin{figure}[h!]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/SVM3}
	\end{figure}
	
	\item Option 2.
	\begin{figure}[h!]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/SVM4}
	\end{figure}
	
	\item Option 3.
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/SVM5}
	\end{figure}
\end{itemize}


%===================================================================%
\subsection*{Question 3}
The SVM solves

% minθ C∑mi=1y(i)cost1(θTx(i))+(1−y(i))cost0(θTx(i))+∑nj=1θ2j
where the functions cost0(z) and cost1(z) look like this:


The first term in the objective is:

% C∑mi=1y(i)cost1(θTx(i))+(1−y(i))cost0(θTx(i)).
This first term will be zero if two of the following four conditions hold true. Which are the two conditions that would guarantee that this term equals zero?

\begin{itemize}
\item For every example with y(i)=1, we have that $ \theta^T x(i)\geq 0$.

\item For every example with y(i)=0, we have that $ \theta^T x(i)\leq 0$.

\item For every example with y(i)=1, we have that $ \theta^T x(i)\geq 1$.

\item For every example with y(i)=0, we have that $ \theta^T x(i)\leq -1$.
\end{itemize}

%===================================================================%
\subsection*{Question 4}
Suppose you have a dataset with n = 10 features and m = 5000 examples.

After training your logistic regression classifier with gradient descent, you find that it has underfit the training set and does not achieve the desired performance on the training or cross validation sets.

Which of the following might be promising steps to take? Check all that apply.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Try using a neural network with a large number of hidden units.
	
	\item Use a different optimization method since using gradient descent to train logistic regression might result in a local minimum.
	
	\item Reduce the number of examples in the training set.
	
	\item Create / add new polynomial features.
\end{itemize}


%===================================================================%
\subsection*{Question 5} 
Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.

\begin{itemize}
	\item If the data are linearly separable, an SVM using a linear kernel will return the same parameters $\theta$ regardless of the chosen value of
	C (i.e., the resulting value of $\theta$ does not depend on C).
	
	\item It is important to perform feature normalization before using the Gaussian kernel.
	
	\item Suppose you are using SVMs to do multi-class classification and 	would like to use the one-vs-all approach. If you have K differentclasses, you will train K - 1 different SVMs.
	
	\item The maximum value of the Gaussian kernel (i.e., sim(x,l(1))) is 1.
\end{itemize}
