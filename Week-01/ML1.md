Octave : Introduction
Change prompt  : PS1('>> ' )
commenting : use the  "%" symbol

Octave : Saving Data

save filename.mat v
load filename.mat v



Octave : Matrices

size(A) : dimensions of matrix A
size(A,1) :  number of rows
size(A,2) :  number of columns
length(V) :  length of vector V


C = B' * A; Tranpose of B multiplied by A

.* computes the element-wise product, not the matrix product
.^ operator perfoms element-wise exponentiation.

B = A(:, 1:2);  selects every row and the first two columns of A.
B = A(1:4, 1:2); selects the first four rows and first two columns of A

ML Course Section 1
 
Machine Learning includes a number of advanced statistical methods for handling regression and classification tasks with multiple dependent and independent variables. 

These methods include
Support Vector Machines (SVM) for regression and classification,
Naive Bayes for classification,
and k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) for regression and classification.
