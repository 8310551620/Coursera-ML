<hr>
Principal component analysis is a method for projecting data into a lower dimensional space. 
It works by finding the space which maximizes the variance of the projections, or equivalently, 
minimizes the reconstruction error. Mathematically, it corresponds to computing the SVD 
of the transformed data, or the spectral decomposition of the covariance matrix.
