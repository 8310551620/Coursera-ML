\section{Recommender Systems}

Information Filtering System that attempts to recommend information items likely
to be of interest to a user.

\textbf{Commonly used algorithms}
\begin{itemize
\item $k-$means clustering
\item Pearson's Rho
\item Collaborative Filtering
\end{itemize}

Collaborative Filtering is the process of filtering for information or patterns using collaboration among multiple
agents.

Applications: online news aggregation or similar items of clothings

best approached by other methods - prediction

\[ \frac{\partial J}{\partial X^{(i)}_k}  = \sum [  ] \theta^{(j)}_k \]
\[ \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta^{(i)}_k}  = \sum [  ] X^{(j)}_k \]

Anomaly Detection
Gaussian Distribution
Estimate Gaussian Distribution

For $n$ feastures of $X$ , compute the mean and variance for each feature

Selecting Threshold of $\epsilon$.

Implement an algorithm to select the threshold $\epsilon$ using an $F_i$ score on a 
cross validation set.

$P(X) < \epsilon$ is considered to be an anomaly.
