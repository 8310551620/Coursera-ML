\section*{Anomaly Detection}

For which of the following problems would anomaly detection be a suitable algorithm?
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)]
Given an image of a face, determine whether or not it is the face of a particular famous individual.\\	\textbf{Conclusion} This problem is more suited to traditional supervised learning, as you want both famous and non-famous images in the training set.
\item[(ii)]
In a computer chip fabrication plant, identify microchips that might be defective.	\\	\textbf{Conclusion} 	The defective chips are the anomalies you are looking for by modeling the properties of non-defective chips.
\item[(iii)]
Given a dataset of credit card transactions, identify unusual transactions to flag them as possibly fraudulent.	\\	\textbf{Conclusion} By modeling "normal" credit card transactions, you can then use anomaly detection to flag the unusuals ones which might be fraudulent.
\item[(iv)]
From a large set of hospital patient records, predict which patients have a particular disease (say, the flu).\\	\textbf{Conclusion} Anomaly detection would not be appropriaate, as you want to train on both types of patient records rather than modeling one as "normal."
