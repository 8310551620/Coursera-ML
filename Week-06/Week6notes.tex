\subsection*{High variance}

\begin{itemize}
\item indicated by gap in errors between training and testing data sets.
\item Algorithm has overfit the data for the training data set.
\item Increasing the regularization parameter will reduce overfitting
\end{itemize}
The recommended way to choose a value of regularization parameter $\lambda$ to use is to choose
the lowest cross validation error.
You should not use the training data set for this purpose.
